chisel
  - (plsql) "show errors" to remove from code
  - (plsql) remove all trailing CRs not just last : works for oracle, good enough for now
  - "it eats its own tail"" changes the p4 keywords in the code :)
     use other way to declare p4 keyword string constants
  - process p4 tags in VIEWS (p4 keywords can be placed in the footer instead of the header)

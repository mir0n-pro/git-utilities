GitUtilities things planned to do:

pre-commit:
: allow long author and file names with spaces, like "Vasiliy Pupkin", "funny names.text"
: chisel do not trim all trailing empty lines: only last one (except plsql mode)
report_gen_tag:
: allow work with fresh new repository: as it now, it requires to have at least 3 commits.
